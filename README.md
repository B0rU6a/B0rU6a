# Hi there! 👋  
I'm Suslov Mark. My native language is Russian, but I can speak English a little.
## Known languages ⌨️
FYI, this is self-assessed — I haven’t taken any official tests yet, LOL.  
| Language | Rough Estimate |
|-|-|
| Python | 25% — currently learning |
| C# (for Unity) | 10% — studied a while ago, mostly forgotten |
| GLua | 3% — learning on and off, depending on my mood |

I also plan to learn *general* C# and C++, but not right now.
## About Me 🙂
I was born in Krasnodar, Russia.  
I'm mainly into tech, but I also enjoy cooking and wakeboarding.
